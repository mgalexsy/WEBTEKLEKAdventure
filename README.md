Double Click on LOGS1 for Midterm GITHUB LOG, shows LOG from end of last log until final due date of Midterm Project 9 APR, 2018.
    ONLY Duane posted data (Class Notes with generic html) to GITHUB to allow collaboration by all Group Members of the Term Project.
    Viv did not complete any work, only mentioned verbally she was creating a QUIZ that was directed by Maceey, not the Group Leader,
    a job listing was previously posted on the Group FB Page.
    Maceey did not post her work on GITHUB, did not allow for collabortation as she was the Lead Designer and Programmer, did not ask for help, 
    did not recommend we create a new GITHUB Page if she was having problems, as we had problems in Prelims and had to recreate a total of three GITHUB Pages 
    so she is aware of previous problems and the method of correction. As documented on PEER EVAL, Maceey completed lots of work behind the scenes.
