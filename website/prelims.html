        <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
        <p>The Grand Canyon  is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado
            River in the state of Arizona in the United States. It is contained
            within and managed by Grand Canyon National Park, the Hualapai Tribal Nation,
            the Havasupai Tribe and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent

            to hunt and enjoy the scenery.
            The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446 km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and

        <h2>The Rocky Mountains</h2>
        <p>The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range
            in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3,000 miles
            (4,830 km) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada,
            to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American
            Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the
            Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie farther to the west.</p>
